# IR language specification (v1)

The textual intermediate representation for managed Loxone logic. File
extension: **`.lxir`**. Encoding: UTF-8, no BOM. Line-oriented: one
statement per line; only a block declaration's `( … )` argument list spans
lines.

This document is normative for what `Module::parse` accepts and what
`Module::to_text` (= `lxir fmt`) emits.

v1 (2026-08-25) replaced v0's keyword statements (`block`/`wire`/`set`)
with constructor syntax — see design decision D16 in
[design.md](design.md). v0 keywords are reserved and produce migration
errors.

Notes:

- A `#` outside a string starts a comment that runs to end of line. All
  comments are preserved by the formatter: whole-line comments are AST
  items, trailing comments attach to their statement (or argument line, or
  the closing `)`), and whole-line comments inside argument lists are
  argument items.
- An argument list may close on the declaration line (a single-line call)
  or span lines; nothing may follow the closing `)` except a comment.
- Whitespace is insignificant except as a token separator. Indentation is
  conventional (the formatter uses one tab inside argument lists).
- A bare identifier in value position is always a **constant reference**;
  it must name a `let` in the same module. A dotted identifier
  (`slug.Port`) is always a **port reference**. String values are always
  quoted.
- A number may carry a **unit suffix** (D27), written immediately
  adjacent: `40s`, `250ms`, `90min`, `1.5h`, `2700K`, `70%`. Time units
  scale exactly into Loxone's base unit, seconds (`1.5h` compiles to
  `Def="5400"`, byte-identical to writing `5400`); `K` (color
  temperature) and `%` are annotations with factor 1. The suffix is part
  of the value's canonical spelling — `1.5h` stays `1.5h` in source and
  through `fmt`. An unknown suffix is a parse error. A *quoted* `"40s"`
  stays a string — two spellings, two meanings.
- The keywords `let`, `extern`, `removed`, `moved`, `template`, `end`,
  `page`, and the expression operators `and`, `or`, `not` are reserved,
  as are v0's `block`, `wire`, `set`, and `use` (migration errors) —
  none can be declared as a name.
- An instantiation is distinguished from a block declaration by the case
  of the callee: `sued = fassade(…)` (lowercase = template name) vs
  `hoch = GreaterEqual(…)` (PascalCase = block type).

## Statements

### `let` — a named constant

```text
let temp_schwelle = 28
```

Declares a name for a number or string. Any value position (argument
lists, extern port assignments) may reference it by bare identifier; the
compiler substitutes the literal before emitting `Def=`, so a `let`
reference compiles byte-identically to writing the literal in place.
Constants cannot reference other constants, and constant names share the
module's one slug namespace (they have no ports and cannot be wired).

### `extern` — reference an object owned by Loxone Config

```text
extern sonne = VirtualIn(iname: "VI3")
extern jal_sued = AutoJalousie(title: "Beschattung Süd")
extern boiler = Switch(uuid: "1d844a67-0333-5301-ffffed57184a04d2")
extern licht_buero = LightController2(title: "Deckenlicht", room: "Büro")
extern status_alarm_ref = InputRef(mirrors: status_alarm)
```

Declares a slug for an existing object in the base config. The compiler
never creates, deletes, or moves externs; it only wires to their ports
(`<-`) and assigns their parameters (`=`).

Match semantics: the object must have the declared type **and** match the
spec. Exactly one object may match — zero is a `NoMatch` error, several is
an `AmbiguousMatch` error listing candidates. Where titles repeat per
room (every floor has a "Deckenlicht"), `room:` and/or `category:`
narrow an `iname`/`title` match: the object's `<IoData Pr=…>`/`Cr=…`
must point at a `Place`/`Category` with that title
([loxone-format.md](loxone-format.md)). They never combine with
`uuid:`, which pins exactly on its own. Once resolved, the UUID is
pinned in the lockfile; subsequent compiles use the pin (even if the title
has changed since) as long as an object with that UUID and type still
exists.

Choosing a matcher: `uuid` pins exactly; `iname` (the `IName=` attribute,
e.g. `VI1`, `AI3`) is locale-stable and preferred for built-in I/O
objects; `title` is human-friendly but locale-volatile — use it only for
objects you named yourself.

**`mirrors:` — match a ref by what it mirrors (D32).** For
`InputRef`/`OutputRef` externs only: `mirrors: <slug>` (a bare slug, no
quotes) matches the ref object whose `Ref=` attribute names the object
that slug resolves to — a managed block with a locked identity, or a
plain-matched extern of the module
([loxone-format.md](loxone-format.md) documents `Ref=`). Where several
refs mirror the same target, the file's `page` statement narrows the
candidates to the declaring page; a still-ambiguous match is refused —
keep `uuid:` for, say, two refs of one flag on the same page. Unlike the
other matchers, a pinned `mirrors:` re-confirms on every compile: the
claim "this ref mirrors X" must stay true, so a ref the GUI re-pointed
elsewhere stops the compile instead of being quietly tolerated.
`room:`/`category:` never combine with it. `decompile`/`adopt` emit
`mirrors:` on their own where the target has a slug in the module and
the match is unique.

**Time functions and other singletons.** The periphery's time sources
(the GUI's *Zeitfunktionen* folder: `DayOfWeek`, `Time`, `Hour`,
`ImpulseMinute`, `ImpulseSunrise`, `StartPulse`, …) and the operating
modes (*Betriebsmodi*, type `Mode`) exist exactly once per project and
carry **no `IName=`**, so the matcher choice narrows: their titles are
locale-volatile like all built-ins (a save can rename `Wochentag` on
you), which leaves `uuid` as the durable pin:

```text
# Zeitfunktionen: singletons, no IName — pin by UUID
extern wochentag = DayOfWeek(uuid: "15ea0aa4-0093-39e4-ffffed57184a04d2")
extern minutenimpuls = ImpulseMinute(uuid: "15ea0aa4-01b6-3a20-ffffed57184a04d2")
extern montag = Mode(uuid: "00000000-0000-0004-1500000000000000")
```

Wiring them follows the normal rules — the singleton's output feeds a
managed block's input directly, no `InputRef` needed even across pages
(oracle-verified for `Mode` wires, sessions 6–7; the time sources are
the same class of periphery singleton). `title:` still *works* for a singleton
while the locale holds, and `adopt` lifts it that way; switching the
lifted spec to `uuid:` is a plain source edit (the lock pins the same
object either way). `Mode` UUIDs are deterministic system UUIDs
(`00000000-…`), identical across projects; time-function UUIDs are
minted per project — read them off `lxir decompile` or the XML.

### Block declaration — a managed logic block

```text
beschatten = And()
temp_hoch = GreaterEqual(
	"Temp über 28",
	Input1: aussentemp.Q,
	Input2: temp_schwelle,
)
```

The compiler owns this object end-to-end: it mints its UUIDs (pinned in
the lock), draws it on the target page, rebuilds it on every compile, and
deletes it when removal is explicitly authorized.

The argument list is the block's entire input situation in one place. The
value decides the meaning:

- `Port: 28`, `Port: "text"`, `Port: constant` — a **parameter**: the
  literal (or resolved `let` constant) becomes `Def=` on the port with key
  `Port`.
- `Port: slug.Port` — a **wire**: the referenced source port is wired into
  this port. Sources may be extern or managed ports (including the block
  itself — feedback is representable) and are referenced before or after
  their declaration.
- `Port: a.Q and b.AQ >= 28` — an **expression** (D26): desugars into
  gate/comparator blocks whose result is wired into the port — the same
  sugar as on `<-` (see [Expressions](#expressions--sugar-over-the-discrete-blocks)).
- An optional leading string is the display **label** (the XML `Title`);
  it defaults to the slug.

Some block types carry **attribute parameters** — block logic stored as an
element attribute rather than a connector. They bind exactly like
parameters but can never take a wire:

```text
summe = Formula("Summe", Formula: "I1+I2", Input1: a.Q, Input2: b.Q)
```

`Formula:` on `Formula` blocks is the only one so far (declared per type
in `connectors::attr_params`); it compiles to `Formula="I1+I2"` on the
`<C>` element, together with the observed `Valid="false"` companion.

Rules:

- At most one parameter binding per port; multiple wire bindings on the
  same port are allowed when the sources differ (fan-in).
- The type must be in the verified builtin table
  (gates `And`/`Or`/`Not`, the comparator family `Equal`/`NotEqual`/
  `Greater`/`GreaterEqual`/`Less`/`LessEqual`, `Formula`, `Monoflop`,
  `PulseGen`, `AnalogThresholdTrigger` — see
  [connector-db.md](connector-db.md)) — anything else is an error. See
  [design.md](design.md) "Refuse, never guess".
- `And`/`Or` are fixed two-input blocks (`I1`, `I2`, `Q`): binding `I3`+
  is an error — Loxone Config silently deletes grown inputs on save
  (design decision D8). Need more inputs? Cascade gates:
  `c = And(I1: a.Q, I2: b.Q)`.
- Types, port names, and wire directions on managed blocks are validated
  **statically** (`lxir check`, no base config needed); unknown names get
  a "did you mean" suggestion when a close candidate exists.

### `<-` — wire onto an extern port

```text
jal_sued.AutoShade <- beschatten.Q
jal_sued.Safety <- wind_alarm.Q
```

Wires a source port onto an extern port. The source must be an output; the
extern port is open-world — it must merely exist in the base config. These
wires are recorded in the lockfile so removing the statement removes the
wire again without touching GUI-drawn wires.

`<-` is for **extern targets only**: a wire into a managed block is
written in that block's argument list — one canonical spelling per fact —
so `<-` on a managed slug is a validation error pointing at the argument
list.

### `=` on a port — write a parameter on an extern port

```text
jal_sued.TargetPos = 70
```

Rewrites the extern port's `Def=`; the original value is recorded in the
lockfile and **restored** when the statement disappears from source.

Like `<-`, this is for **extern targets only**. A managed block's
parameters belong in its argument list — assigning a managed port is a
validation error pointing there. Assigning a port reference
(`x.Port = y.Q`) is a parse error suggesting `<-`.

### `removed` — authorize deleting a managed block

```text
removed temp_hoch
```

Declares that `temp_hoch`'s absence from source is intentional: the next
compile deletes the block from the config and moves its lockfile entry to
a removal tombstone (D31), which keeps deleting the object from bases that
predate the deployment of that compile's output. Scoped to exactly one
slug and reviewable in the diff — prefer it over the global
`--allow-removals` flag. The statement may be deleted right after the
compile that applies it (the tombstone carries the intent from there); it
is tolerated while the tombstone is pending, and once the removal has
reached the deployed config a lingering statement is a compile error.
Declaring a slug and `removed`-ing it in the same module is an error.

### `moved` — rename a managed block, keeping identity

```text
moved beschatten -> schatten_gate
```

Renames the lockfile entry so the block's identity — object *and* port
UUIDs, layout — survives a slug rename in source: rename the declaration
(and its reference sites), add the `moved` line, compile. Idempotent: once
the new slug carries the lock entry, the statement is done and can be
deleted. It is an error when neither slug is in the lockfile (typo guard),
when the old slug is still declared, or when moves are chained
(`a -> b`, `b -> c`).

### `page` — place the following blocks on a named page

```text
page "Beschattung"

wp_ein = And(
	I1: soll.AQ >= 1.5h,
)
```

Names the `<C Type="Page">` (by display title, as in the base config) that
the block declarations after it are built on — until the next `page`
statement. Blocks above the first `page` statement keep the default page
(`--page`, the project file, or the document's first page). Placement is
positional, so the synthetic blocks of an expression land on the page the
expression is written under.

The statement is **authoritative**: on every compile a governed block is
pinned to a base page with the declared title. A pin that still matches a
page so titled is kept — titles need not be unique, and adopted blocks
never move behind your back — any other pin is re-pinned to the first
matching page in document order (the block visibly moves in Loxone
Config), and a title no page carries is a compile error. Creating pages
stays with Loxone Config; the statement only places blocks on pages that
exist.

`page` is not allowed inside a template body — placement belongs to the
module. The decompiler emits `page` statements as section headers (the
periphery, which is not a page, keeps a `# periphery` comment), so a
decompiled or adopted module records its placement in reviewable source.

### `template` — a reusable, parameterized body

```text
template fassade(jalousie: AutoJalousie, schwelle = 28, pos = 70)
	hoch = GreaterEqual(I2: schwelle)
	hoch.I1 <- temp_aussen.AQ
	beschatten = And(I1: hoch, I2: jalousie.Sd)
	jalousie.TargetPos = pos
end

sued = fassade(jalousie: jal_sued)
west = fassade(jalousie: jal_west, pos: 55)
```

A `template` declares a body of blocks, wires and sets once; each
instantiation stamps out an independent copy. The lowercase callee is what
distinguishes an instantiation from a block declaration: `sued =
fassade(…)` calls the template `fassade`, while `hoch = GreaterEqual(…)`
declares a `GreaterEqual` block (block types are PascalCase).

Parameters come in two forms. An **object parameter** (`jalousie:
AutoJalousie`) is required at every call site and passes a slug; the
annotation is checked against the argument's declared type when it is
known. A **value parameter** (`pos = 70`) carries a default and may be
overridden with a literal or a `let` reference. Free identifiers in the
body that are not parameters capture the module's surrounding names
(externs, lets, blocks), like any other reference.

Expansion is pure macro substitution before compile: body slug `hoch` in
instance `sued` becomes `sued_hoch`, and that **expanded slug is the
lockfile key**. Re-instantiating therefore never re-mints; editing the
body mints only what is new in each instance; `removed` and `moved` apply
per expanded slug (`removed sued_hoch`). Reference an instance's blocks by
their expanded names.

A call-site binding that names no template parameter forwards as a
**port binding** onto the body's single block — an instance is a
composite block, so its call reads exactly like a block declaration
with the shared parameters factored away:

```text
fenster = jalousie(
	titel: "Fenster Jalousie Bastian",
	zeit_hoch: 20,
	EndUp: touch_bastian_i2.Q,
	EndUp: touch_bastian_tuer_i2.Q,
	EndDown: touch_bastian_i5.Q,
)
```

Forwarded feeds may repeat, exactly as in a block's argument list, and
resolve in module scope (never against the template's parameters). The
expanded block re-validates them, so a typo surfaces as an unknown
port with the block's known ports listed. A template whose body
declares more than one block takes no forwards (a qualified form is
deferred with D23's other extensions).

A block title in the body may interpolate value parameters:
`"{titel} (scharf)"` substitutes the parameter's string at expansion, so
each instance carries its own app-visible title. The placeholder must
name a value parameter whose value is a string (a `let` reference to a
string constant also works); a brace-wrapped slug naming no value
parameter is an error (typo guard), and braces around anything not
slug-shaped pass through verbatim.

The body may contain only block declarations, wires, sets and comments —
no nesting, no template-local `let`/`extern` (deferred, D23). `template`
and `end` are reserved words; `use` is reserved for the v0 migration
error.

### Expressions — sugar over the discrete blocks

```text
let schwelle = 28

jal_sued.AutoShade <- sonne.Q and aussentemp.Q >= schwelle

wp_ein = And(
	I1: wassertemp.AQ < wunschtemp and abdeckung_offen.Q,
	I2: pv_ueberschuss.AQ >= pv_schwelle,
)
```

The RHS of `<-` and the value of an argument binding (D26) may be a
boolean expression; it desugars — before compile, like template
expansion — into the verified discrete blocks:
`and`/`or` become `And`/`Or` (fixed 2-input, longer chains cascade
left-associatively), `not` becomes `Not`, and each comparison becomes
one comparator block (`>=` → `GreaterEqual`, `>` → `Greater`, `<=` →
`LessEqual`, `<` → `Less`, `==` → `Equal`, `!=` → `NotEqual`). Operand
order is preserved: the left side binds `Input1`, the right side
`Input2`; a port operand becomes a wire, a number or `let` reference
becomes the port's `Def=` parameter. Each generated block's label is
its sub-expression text, so the rule stays readable on the Loxone
Config canvas. A bare `slug.Port` stays a plain wire, a bare value a
plain parameter — parenthesizing one changes nothing (one canonical
spelling per fact).

Precedence, loosest to tightest: `or` < `and` < `not` < comparison <
`+ -` < `* /`; parentheses group. Comparisons take plain operands (a
port, a number, or a constant — at least one side a port) and do not
chain — write `a.AQ >= 5 and a.AQ < 10`, not `5 <= a.AQ < 10`. A
constant cannot drive a gate input directly; compare it. Gates take
boolean ports or sub-expressions.

**Arithmetic — one `Formula` block** (D35). `+ - * /` may form the
whole RHS of `<-` or a whole argument binding:

```text
verbrauch_kw.AI <- verbrauch.AQ / 1000
```

A maximal arithmetic tree desugars into ONE `Formula` block — here
`verbrauch_kw_ai__f1` with `Formula: "I1/1000"` and `Input1` wired from
`verbrauch.AQ`, the sink fed from the block's `AQ`. Distinct port
operands become `Input1`…`Input4` in first-appearance order (a repeated
port reuses its input; more than 4 distinct ports is an error — split
the expression). Numbers and numeric `let` references are inlined into
the compact formula text (negative constants parenthesized: `I1*(-2)`);
unit values (`40s`) and strings are rejected — formulas compute on
plain numbers. The block's label is the expression text, as with every
synthetic block, and identity works exactly like the discrete backend
(slug operator `f`, expression-owned lock entry). Arithmetic *under*
gates or comparisons (`a.Q and x.AQ + 1`, `x.AQ + 1 >= 5`) is deferred:
declare an explicit `Formula` block and use its `AQ`.

**Identity.** The generated blocks get synthetic slugs
`<sink>_<port>__<op><n>` (post-order walk, one counter per operator;
the sink is the extern port on `<-`, the managed block's port for an
argument binding) — here `jal_sued_autoshade__ge1`,
`jal_sued_autoshade__and1`, and `wp_ein_i1__lt1` — and are keyed in the
lockfile like hand-written blocks, but marked expression-owned. An unchanged expression therefore never re-mints.
Editing the expression re-derives its slugs, and the compiler
auto-removes the orphaned expression-owned entries — no `removed`
statement needed: the expression is the blocks' single source of
truth. Declaring a slug that collides with an expression's synthetic
namespace is an error. Inside a template body, desugaring runs after
expansion, so the synthetic prefix uses the instance's actual sink.

## Name resolution and validation

- Externs, blocks, and `let` constants share one namespace per module;
  duplicates are an error.
- Every port reference (argument bindings, `<-`, `=`) must name a declared
  extern or block; every bare-identifier value must name a declared `let`.
- `<-` and port-`=` targets must be externs (see above).
- Duplicate parameter bindings, and duplicate identical wire bindings, in
  one argument list are errors.
- `removed`/`moved` must not contradict declarations or each other
  (details under the statements).
- Statement order is free; the conventional order is lets, externs,
  blocks, extern wires, extern assignments, with lifecycle statements
  (`moved`, `removed`) last.

`lxir check` performs all of the above plus the static builtin-table
checks (block types, port names, wire directions) — everything that does
not need the base config. `--json` emits the result machine-readably.

## Multi-file modules and projects

A module may be a directory of `*.lxir` fragments instead of one file.
Fragments parse individually (errors name the file), then concatenate —
subdirectories included, in path order — into one module; name resolution
runs once on the whole, so a fragment may freely reference slugs declared
in a sibling file. The split carries no semantics: one namespace, one
lockfile, and **no `import` statement** (decision D25 — an import would
name a dependency that has no semantic consequence). It is source
ergonomics, with one file per page as the convention (`_periphery.lxir`
for the externs). Dot-entries (`.git`, editor caches) are skipped. One
statement is positional across the merge: a `page` statement (D28)
governs following blocks until the next one, fragment boundaries
included — so open every fragment that declares blocks with its `page`
statement (the decompiler and adopt do). Beyond that, merge order
affects nothing but determinism.

A directory with a `lox.toml` is a **project** — one deployment target:

```toml
base = "r50.Loxone"      # the deployed config (required)
module = "pages"         # module file or fragment directory (required)
lock = "r50.lock.json"   # default lxir.lock.json
out = "out.Loxone"       # default out.Loxone
serial = "504F94A26236"  # optional; the first compile records it in the lock
page = "lxir"            # optional page title for newly placed blocks
```

The format is a strict flat subset of TOML — `key = "string"` pairs and
`#` comments; tables, arrays, and unquoted values are refused with
pointed errors. Paths are relative to the file. `module` deliberately has
no default: a stray `.lxir` view or backup next to the file must never be
compiled by accident. Inside the directory, `lxir compile` needs no flags
(flags override the file), and `check`/`fmt`/`drift` default to the
project's module and lock.

## Canonical form

`lxir fmt` emits: statements in source order, single spaces between
tokens, one blank line whenever the item kind changes and after every
multi-line block declaration. An argument-free call stays on one line
(`b = And()`, `c = Or("Oder")`); a call with bindings puts the label and
each argument on its own tab-indented line with a trailing comma, and the
`)` on its own line. Values keep their variant: numbers bare, strings
quoted, constant references bare, port references dotted, unit values
with their suffix as written. The one value
canonicalization happens at parse time: a quoted string that reads exactly
as a number (`"28"`) becomes the bare number, so every value has one
canonical spelling. `parse(to_text(m)) == m`, and `to_text` is a fixpoint.

## Errors

Parse errors carry a 1-based line number. Unknown types, ports, and
constants suggest the closest known name when one is within a small edit
distance. v0 statements (`block`, `wire`, `set`, `extern … match …`) get
migration errors describing the v1 spelling. Compile errors are documented
with remedies in [agents.md](agents.md#errors-and-remedies).

## Versioning

This is v1; there are no v0 files in the wild (pre-release revision).
Anything not specified here (template nesting and template-local
declarations, the `formula` expression backend, per-port unit checking)
is future work —
see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md). Future versions will keep v1 files parsing
unchanged or provide a migration tool.
