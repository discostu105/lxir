//! The compiler: base config + IR module + lockfile → new config.
//!
//! The compiler owns exactly three kinds of edits and touches nothing else
//! in the (losslessly parsed) base document:
//!
//! 1. **Managed blocks** — `slug = Type(…)` declarations are (re)built from
//!    scratch on every compile, with identity pinned by the lockfile.
//! 2. **Extern wires** — wires whose sink is an extern port
//!    (`target.Port <- source.Port`) are added to the extern's `<Co>`; the
//!    lockfile records them so removing the statement removes the `<In>`
//!    again without disturbing wires drawn in Loxone Config.
//! 3. **Extern sets** — `target.Port = value` on an extern port rewrites its
//!    `Def=`; the pre-set value is remembered and restored when the
//!    statement disappears.
//!
//! Everything is deterministic: same base + module + lock + options → the
//! same output bytes. New UUIDs come from [`crate::uuid::Minter`] (no clock,
//! no RNG) and are recorded in the lock immediately, so later compiles reuse
//! them.
//!
//! v0 limitations (documented, checked, erroring — never silent):
//! - Only block types in [`crate::connectors::builtin`] can be created.
//! - Wiring or assigning an extern port requires that port's `<Co>` to exist
//!   in the base config (Loxone omits nothing we have observed, but an
//!   unverified type could; we refuse to invent port UUIDs for them).
//! - `And`/`Or` are fixed two-input blocks: wiring `I3`+ is an error. The
//!   Wine oracle showed Loxone Config 17 silently deletes off-descriptor
//!   connectors (and their wires) on save, so minting them would lose logic.
